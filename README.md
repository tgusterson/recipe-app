# recipe-app

This is my attempt at creating the recipe app idea suggested by Andrew Mead at the end of his Modern JavaScript Bootcamp course (see https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/).

It's a simple web app written in vanilla JS that takes advantage of local storage in the browser to store recipes.

## Getting Started

* Download and extract the code
* Spin up a local server or open up index.html in your browser
* You can find a live example of the app here: https://tgusterson.github.io/recipe-app/

## Using the app

To use the app, start by clicking the "Add Recipe" button. You'll be taken to a page where you can input the information for that recipe (its name, the steps to follow, the required ingredients).

Everything you type is automatically saved to local storage, so when you visit the app again, the data entered persists!


## Built With
